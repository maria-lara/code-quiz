## Description
The purpose of this project was to create an online quiz. The goal is to have the user go through a series of questions to determine their level of knowledge for the Real Housewives while being timed. All quiz questions highlight the craziest events that have happened in housewife history. At the end, the quiz will display the user's inputted initals and their score for the day.

This quiz was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a lot of jQuery. 

So, how well do you know your housewives?
